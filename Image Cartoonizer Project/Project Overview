Overview:

For this project we have used open cv techniques to convert our image into Cartoonized form. The project solely uses the non â€“ deep learning and non- machine learning techniques.
Phases of project:

The project is completed in 4 phases.
Smoothening the image.

Preserving the image edge.

Adding weights in filtered edge preserved image and Gaussian image and then combining them to get the edges highlighted image.

Applying the binary thresholding with adaptive thresholding to get the edges only

Finally applying bitwise operation on the weighted image and the edged image to get Cartoonized image.

( The detailed description of each step and operation applied in this project is given in .ipynb notebook )
